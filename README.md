# Halovi
Halovi is a vi-like language for web scraping and automation. Upon execution it will read a scroll of alien language, summoning headless browsers and neovims to perform dark magic on webpages. That's pretty spooky, thus halovi (as in Halloween).

# Building

```bash
(cd nm && npm install)
pip install neovim
stack build
stack install # To install Halovi globally
stack exec halovi -- -f somefile -i somearg # To run without installing
```

This is going to take a while..

#### Dependencies

```bash
node
npm
stack
neovim
python3
neovim (python)
```

# Note

Halovi is far from done; I am not even close to implementing all the features that I want from it! See [TODO.md](/TODO.md) and feel free to post feature requests.

Halovi currently does not support multiple windows, because I have to wait for [this](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/pull/554).
